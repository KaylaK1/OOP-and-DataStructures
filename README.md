# OOP-and-DataStructures
My review of a second semester programing course: CSE 205: Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures.

Learning Objectives:
1. Concepts of Data Structures
  Write programs using basic predefined Java data structures such as ArrayList.
  Write programs to implement data structures: linked lists, queues, stacks, and trees.
  Identify the appropriate data structures to use in a program to solve a problem.
2. Object Oriented Language Constructs
  Write programs using text files as input and output.
  Design and implement GUI (graphical user interfaces) programs.
  Write a complete Java application using OO concepts such as inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, and abstract classes.
  Write programs that perform exception handling.
3. Introduction to Algorithmic Complexity Theory
  Understand the definition of O (“Big Oh”) and derive the Big O complexity of an algorithm.
  Derive and explain the efficiency of sorting algorithms, e.g., selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort.
  Derive and explain the efficiency of searching algorithms, e.g., linear search and binary search.
  Explain the differences between various complexity classes such as O(1), O(n), O(n2), and O(n lg n).

Major Topics:

Recursion
Linear Search
Binary Search
Introduction to data structures and algorithms
Algorithmic time complexity and Big O notation

Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Linked Lists
Stacks
Queues

Trees
